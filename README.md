## Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be defined as the automatic manipulation of
natural language like text and speech by a software. NLP is what makes it possible for
computers to read the text and interpret it. Text Summarisation is a subset of NLP
which is used for shortening long pieces of text while retaining the key information
content and overall meaning. There are two different approaches, namely Extractive
Summarisation and Abstractive Summarisation. This project is based on the Abstractive
Summarisation which is quite advanced than the former. Abstractive Summarisation
generates new sentences, possibly rephrasing or using the words that were not in the
original text. This ensures that the core information is conveyed through the shortest
text possible. This reduces reading time and accelerates the process of searching the
information. Currently, there is a huge amount of data that is exponentially emerging in
the market. So, In this project we intend to provide a solution for shortening the data
using Abstractive Summarisation.
